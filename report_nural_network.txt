Report on the Neural Network Model:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding from non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be successful or not.


Data Preprocessing

1) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

-- 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from this dataset was considered as target for this model.

2) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
-- After dropping unimportant columns (like 'EIN' and 'NAME') 'APPLICATION_TYPE','AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS','INCOME_AMT','SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS','ASK_AMT'- these columns were considered to be features for this dataset.


3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
-- 'EIN' and 'NAME'-these two cols were considered as unnecessary for this model ans were removed.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

4) How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

-- I selected 3 hiddenlayers with 24,16,1 numbers of nurons respectively in each layer for this neural network model and activation function as relu for 1st and 2 nd hidden layers and sigmoid function for output layer.I have selected nuron numbers to keep them more than half of the number of inputs for each layer to train the model better.And I have selected relu as activation function for hidden layers because the constant gradient of ReLUs results in faster learning. For output layer i have selected Sigmoid function for output layer as its output is smoother than Relu.


Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

-- I have achieved 73% accuracy .

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

-- I dropped outliers, increased no. of bins in some columns, and tried different combination of hidden layers, number of nurons and activation function to optimize the model.



Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

--By this model we can predict whether or not applicants for funding from non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be successful or not upto 73% accuracy.This dataset might need more features to make this model more accurate for prediction.
