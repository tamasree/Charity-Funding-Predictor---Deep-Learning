Report on the Neural Network Model:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding from non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be successful or not.


Data Preprocessing

1) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

-- 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from this dataset was considered as target for this model.

2) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
-- After dropping unimportant columns (like 'EIN' and 'NAME') 'APPLICATION_TYPE','AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS','INCOME_AMT','SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS','ASK_AMT'- these columns were considered to be features for this dataset.


3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
-- 'EIN' and 'NAME'-these two cols were considered as unnecessary for this model ans were removed.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?





Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
